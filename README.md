# Simple-Linear-Regression Using Fortran and Python
Simple Linear Regression to Predict Fuel Consumption of Cars using Horsepower using FORTRAN and Python.
This system aims to model the relationship between fuel consumption (mpg) and horsepower(fps).
The goal is to figure out if horsepower changes affect the cars' fuel consumption. 
The system will examine statistical correlations between horsepower and fuel consumption.

I used some Python code for the first part of the project and the main program is written in Fortran
